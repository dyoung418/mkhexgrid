## Fixtures

The files in the fixtures directory are manually generated and
manually verified, then archived for use as test cases.

The integration tests run an identical script, then diff the
output from modified source code. If the output is not identical,
test fails.

If actual functionality changes, these fixture files may need
to be updated.
